# kickjs

kickjs is an ES6 boilerplate template system for quick prototyping.

It allows you to quickly start a new project simply by typing `kickjs` from your Terminal window.

You'll be prompted to type the projects `name` (mandatory) and `description` (optional).

You'll also be given an option to have all the npm dependencies installed for you. If you don't want to, you can always run `npm install` later.

## Installation
Make sure you have [node.js](http://nodejs.org/) installed.
```shell
npm install -g kickjs
```

## Templates
Templates are installed as sub-modules. The original source can be found [here](https://github.com/andrevenancio/kickjs-templates)
