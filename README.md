# kickjs

kickjs is an ES6 boilerplate template system for quick prototyping.
It allows you to quickly start a new project simply by typing `kickjs` from your Terminal window.
You'll be prompted to type the projects `name` (mandatory) and `description` (optional). You can choose several of the built in templates (default, react, electron+react).
